  Improve the algorithm for anticipating future leap seconds.
  
2018-11-11 2:0:0
  Replace variable_length_seconds_before_1972 with
  variable_length_seconds_before_year.  To use fixed-length
  seconds always, specify INT_MIN.  To use variable length
  seconds before 1972, specify 1972.

  Update the list of dependencies in the README for Fedora 29.

  Improve the prediction of future leap seconds.
  
2018-09-22 1:13:0
  Move the prediction of the next leap second from December 31, 2020
  to June 30, 2020, based on the IERS predictions of the rotation
  rate of the Earth, projected into the future.

  Update to IERS Bulletin C 56, issued July 5, 2018, which states
  that no leap second will be introduced at the end of December,
  2018, so UTC-TAI will remain at -37 seconds for the next six
  months, at least.

  Add a section on International Atomic Time.
  
2017-11-19 1:7:0
  Add support for pkg-config, make check and make distcheck.
  Recommend CLOCK_REALTIME instead of CLOCK_MONOTONIC because
  CLOCK_MONITONIC does not count while the computer is suspended,
  and therefore can change its epoch while an application is running.

  Improve the MAN file.

  Prepare the distribution kit for github.
  
2017-08-27 1:4:0
  Add a MAN page.

  Use Automake in the build procedure.
  Distribute the software using the customary GNU packaging,
  with the PDF file as its documentation.  Continue to include
  the software in the PDF as embedded files.  Build the PDF
  only if requested.  Update to IERS Bulletin C 54, issued
  July 6, 2017, which states that no leap second will be introduced
  at the end of December, 2017, so UTC-TAI will remain at
  -37 seconds for the next six months, at least.

  Minor typographical changes, add test_local.c,
  work around compiler over-optimization in int128\_to\_string.

2017-01-27 1:1:0
  Update the Makefile and some of the test programs
  based on feedback from Steve Summit.

2017-01-18 1:0:0
  Added the ability to use variable length seconds before 1972.
  
2017-01-10 0:2:0
  Updated to IERS Bulletin C 53,
  issued January 9, 2017, which states that UTC-TAI
  will remain at -37 seconds for the next six months, at least.

  Added a description of the stat function,
  the list of entry points and the kernel recommendations.
  Handle converting -2^127 to a string.
