  Move the prediction of the next leap second from December 31, 2020
  to June 30, 2020, based on the IERS predictions of the rotation
  rate of the Earth, projected into the future.

  Update to IERS Bulletin C56, issued July 5, 2018, which states
  that no leap second will be introduced at the end of December,
  2018, so UTC-TAI will remain at -37 seconds for the next six
  months, at least.

  Add a section on International Atomic Time.
  
2017-11-19 1:7:0
  Add support for pkg-config, make check and make distcheck.
  Recommend CLOCK_REALTIME instead of CLOCK_MONOTONIC because
  CLOCK_MONITONIC does not count while the computer is suspended,
  and therefore can change its epoch while an application is running.

  Use Automake in the build procedure.
  Distribute the software using the customary GNU packaging,
  with the PDF file as its documentation.  Continue to include
  the software in the PDF as embedded files.  Build the PDF
  only if requested.  Update to IERS Bulletin C 54, issued
  July 6, 2017, which states that no leap second will be introduced
  at the end of December, 2017, so UTC-TAI will remain at
  -37 seconds for the next six months, at least.
