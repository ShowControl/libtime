/* Subroutine to compute the difference, in seconds, between two 
 * instants of Coordinated Universal time.
 *
 * The parameter variable_length_seconds_before_year controls
 * the interpretation of seconds before the specified year.  
 * Before the invention of the atomic clock in 1955, 
 * it was adequate to define the second as 1/86,400 of the length 
 * of a mean solar day.  By 1960 it had become clear to the 
 * scientific world that the Earth's rotation was no longer 
 * steady enough for the most accurate clocks, so the definition 
 * of a second was changed from Earth-based to atomic-based.
 *
 * Civil time has always been based on the days and the seasons,
 * so it was necessary to make the new second fit into the
 * variable-length day.  By 1972 the current procedure was settled
 * on, in which there are a varying number of fixed-length seconds
 * in each day.
 *
 * Depending on your application's needs, you will want time before
 * 1972 to be measured using modern fixed-length seconds, or
 * the variable-length seconds that were being used at the time.
 * For example, consider this problem: "A beam of light left the 
 * Earth on January 1, 1970, at 00:00 UTC.  How far from Earth was 
 * it on January 1, 2017, at 00:00 UTC?"  To answer that question 
 * you would use modern, fixed-length seconds.  If the problem is
 * "Fredrick was born on February 29, 1856.  How old was he
 * on December 1, 1879?", you would use contemporary seconds.  
 *
 * You should use variable-length seconds when you are concerned
 * with the time as told by a contemporary clock, such as reckoning 
 * birthdays, and fixed-length seconds when you are concerned with 
 * activities that are not based on a clock, such as the time it takes 
 * an object to fall through a given distance.
 *
 * If you want to use fixed-length seconds for all dates, set
 * variable_length_seconds_before_year to INT_MIN.  If you want 
 * fixed-length seconds starting January 1, 1972, but variable-length
 * seconds before January 1, 1972, set variable_length_seconds_before_year
 * to 1972.  If you want to ignore leap seconds entirely, set
 * variable_length_seconds_before_year to INT_MAX.
