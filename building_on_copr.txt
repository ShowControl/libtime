Building on Fedora Copr, November 5, 2019

To build libtime using Fedora Copr, and thus have an internet-accessible
repository, proceed as follows:

1. Perform whatever updates are called for to the libtime sources.

2. Update the version number to today's date, and update the version-info
   triplet, in all the places where they appear.

3. Build and test the libtime tarball.

4. Copy the tarball to ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/

5. cd ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

6. Use this command to create the SRPM in ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/ and
   verify that the RPM can be built on my configuration.
   rpmbuild -ta <name of the tarball>.

7. cd ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS

8. Make sure the spec file is able to deal with OpenSUSE:
   mock -r opensuse-tumbleweed-x86_64 <name of the SRPM file>

9. Now use Fedora COPR to build all of the configurations:
   copr-cli build libtime <name of the SRPM>

9. When the build is finished, use an internet browser to connect to
   the Fedora Copr weh site, log in, and examine the results of the
   build.  You can also adjust which platforms are built.  Re-run
   the previous step to do the build again.  Refresh the repositories
   if all is well.
